# Agentic AI - Learning Journey

A repository for exploring and learning about agentic AI through assignments, projects, and experiments.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a collection of my work in the field of agentic artificial intelligence, including:

- 📚 Course assignments and homework
- 🚀 Personal projects and experiments
- 🔬 Research implementations
- 📝 Learning notes and documentation

## Structure

```

## Getting Started

This repository will be continuously updated as I progress through my learning journey in agentic AI. Each folder will contain its own README with specific instructions and documentation.

## Topics Covered

As I progress, this repository will include work on:

- Agent architectures and design patterns
- Multi-agent systems
- Reinforcement learning for agents
- LLM-based agents
- Tool use and function calling
- Planning and reasoning
- Human-AI collaboration
